very early, rough draft of new ABGC mapping pipeline script.

The script is designed to:
- pull data from the repositories automatically based on individual ID, which can be passed as an option (-i).
- prepare data for mapping:
  * create temporary repository
  * trimming by sickle
  * convert from Illumina fq to Sanger fq, if needed (automated detection)
- mapping using BWA mem (currently only option, more mapping options will follow)
- sort BAM files
- merge all BAM files of same individual, and reheader
- do old-school variant calling using samtools pileup

TO DO:
  * add filtering of BAM files based on mapping Q
  * add local re-alignment using GATK
  * do dedup (samtools or Picard?)
  * do recallibration (optional)
  * do variant calling (samtools mpileup)
  * do variant calling (GATK UnifiedGenotyper)
  * do intersection of variants by Samtools and GATK (maybe)
  * do Variant Effect Predictor (VEP)

Suggestion: re-organize variant calling subroutines to separate script.
